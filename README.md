# Mix-It-Up-

Mix it UP!

When I open the screen I see a lovely background (maybe a bar at a beach?).
There is a search box where I can enter the name of a cocktail. When I enter the name, I receive a list of ingredients, directions for making the drink and an image of the finished drink. My search history is saved.

There is a search box to search by ingredient (gin, vodka, etc.). When I enter an ingredient, I receive a list of 5 drinks. If I click on a drink, ingredients, directions and an image of the finished drink is displayed. 

App should work on multiple screen sizes.
